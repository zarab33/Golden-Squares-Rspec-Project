# {{PROBLEM}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can record my experiences
I want to keep a regular diary

As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences
I want to read my past diary entries

As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences in my busy day
I want to select diary entries to read based on how much time I have and my reading speed

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to keep a todo list along with my diary

As a user
So that I can keep track of my contacts
I want to see a list of all of the mobile phone numbers in all my diary entries

## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ MusicPlayer                │
│                            │
│ - add(track)               │
│ - all                      │
│ - search_by_title(keyword) │
│   => [tracks...]           │
└───────────┬────────────────┘
            │
            │ owns a list of
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Track(title, artist)    │
│                         │
│ - title                 │
│ - artist                │
│ - format                │
│   => "TITLE by ARTIST"  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```ruby
class MusicLibrary
  def initialize
    # ...
  end

  def add(track) # track is an instance of Track
    # Track gets added to the library
    # Returns nothing
  end

  def all
    # Returns a list of track objects
  end

  def search_by_title(keyword) # keyword is a string
    # Returns a list of tracks with titles that include the keyword
  end
end

class Track
  def initialize(title, artist) # title and artist are both strings
  end

  def format
    # Returns a string of the form "TITLE by ARTIST"
  end
end
```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# Gets all tracks
library = MusicLibrary.new
track_1 = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track.new("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.all # => [track_1, track_2]
```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# Constructs a track
track = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
