# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe



## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```ruby
reading_time = estimate_reading_time(text)

(text) is a sting with words
reading_time is a result that represents a number which would mean minutes.

```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

```ruby

1. estimate_reading_time("")
=> 0

2. estimate_reading_time("one")
=> 1

3. estimate_reading_time("Two hundred words")
=> 1

4. estimate_reading_time("Three hundred words")
=> 2

5. estimate_reading_time("Four hundred words")
=> 2

6. estimate_reading_time("Twenty thousand words")
=> 100

```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
