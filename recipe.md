# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# `extract_upper` extracts uppercase words from a string
uppercase_words = extract_uppercase(mixed_words)

mixed_words: a string (e.g. "hello WORLD")
uppercase_words: a list of strings (e.g. ["WORLD"])

# The method doesn't print anything or have any other side-effects
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

extract_uppercase("hello WORLD") => ["WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("HELLO WORLD") => ["HELLO", "WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("hello world") => []
extract_uppercase("hello WoRLD") => []
extract_uppercase("hello WORLD!") => ["WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("") => []
extract_uppercase(nil) throws an error
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
